# Real Time Face Recognition Attendance Management Software

## Introduction
This project aims to revolutionize the attendance process in educational institutions by implementing a real-time face recognition system. Traditional attendance methods are time-consuming and prone to errors, whereas this system offers a convenient and efficient alternative.

## Motivation
The motivation behind this project stems from the inefficiencies of manual attendance systems prevalent in many educational institutes. By automating the attendance process through face recognition, we aim to save time and ensure accurate attendance records.

## Problem Definition
The project seeks to develop an automatic face recognition attendance management system using machine learning techniques. The system will identify students' faces and mark their attendance automatically, eliminating the need for manual entry.

## Literature Survey
We reviewed existing literature on attendance management systems, focusing on their methodologies and conclusions. Previous studies highlighted the drawbacks of manual attendance systems and emphasized the need for automated solutions.

## Software Requirements and Specification
### Functional Requirements
- User Interfaces: Compatible with Windows and Android platforms
- Hardware Interfaces: Internet connectivity required
- Software Interfaces: Utilizes Python (Tkinter) as front-end and MySQL as back-end
- Communication Interfaces: HTTP protocol for internet communication

### Non-functional Requirements
- Performance: System operates efficiently with 2GB/4GB of RAM
- Safety and Security: System designed with error detection and fix capabilities
- Software Quality Attributes: Emphasizes reliability, usability, maintainability, and supportability

## System Design
### Haar Cascade Algorithm
